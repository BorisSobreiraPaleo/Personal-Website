## Description 📑

This website serves as a professional showcase, made in React.js, meticulously crafted to exhibit the breadth and depth of my expertise and capabilities in the web development field

## What have I learned in this project? 🧠

Throughout the course of this project, I have acquired significant competencies in website development utilizing the React.js framework from its inception. This experience has enabled me to deepen my mastery of various complementary tools and technologies, such as Tailwind CSS for efficient design and styling management, Git for version control practices to ensure the integrity and traceability of the source code, as well as the successful configuration and deployment of domain names (DNS) to guarantee accessibility and visibility of the project on the web.
